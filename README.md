**About virtual File System**

* In this project we emulate all data structure which are used by operating system to manage file system oriented tasks.
* As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage.
* In this project we create all data structures which requried for File Subsystem as Inode, Inode Table, File Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor Table , Super block, Disk Inode List Block , data Block, Boot Bloct etc
* We provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open , close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.
* While Providing the Implemenations of all above funcationality we use our own data structure by Referring Algorithms of UNNIX operating system.
* By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
